# Image-to-LaTeX

Image to LaTeX code

Current Website: convertlatex.net

This is a program which uses Google Cloud's Vision API to convert images into usable LaTeX code.
The website is currently being run with tornado on Google's Cloud Compute Engine.

Currently, it's unable to convert images with no text, or images that have equations in them.
